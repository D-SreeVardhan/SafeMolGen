# Conditioned training – live monitor

## Option B (recommended): progress bar + continuous
Run in your terminal (from project root):
  cd SafeMolGen-DrugOracle
  ./scripts/watch_cond_training.sh
  # or: python3 scripts/watch_cond_training.py

You get a live progress bar (e.g. PRETRAIN Epoch 2/10 [=========>    ] 45%) and RL Reward/Validity. Ctrl+C to stop watching (training keeps running).

Status file for external monitoring: logs/cond_monitor_status.txt
  (phase, epoch, batch, loss or reward/validity, progress bar)

## Logs
- Full output: logs/cond_train_live.log
- Flow: Pretrain (10 ep, 50k) → RL (5 ep) → checkpoints/generator_rl

## When done
- Checkpoints: checkpoints/generator (cond_dim=25), checkpoints/generator_rl
- Use app with "Use RL model" for the conditioned pipeline.
