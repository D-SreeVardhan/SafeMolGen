# Production training for SafeMolGen (best model possible).
# Use: python scripts/train_generator.py --production
# Or run scripts/run_production_train.sh for full pretrain + RL.

pretrain:
  epochs: 30
  limit: 200000
  batch_size: 128
  checkpoint_every: 5
  # Optional larger model (uncomment and use --d-model --num-layers in script):
  # d_model: 384
  # num_layers: 8
  # dim_feedforward: 768

rl:
  epochs: 15
  batch_size: 16

# Best checkpointing: pretrain saves best by validity; RL saves best by reward.
# Final checkpoint (model.pt) is the best, not the last epoch.
